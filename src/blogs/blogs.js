    content: `Facewash is an essential part of skincare, designed to cleanse the skin by removing dirt, oil, makeup, and impurities. It helps unclog pores, preventing breakouts and maintaining a fresh complexion. Choosing the right facewash depends on skin type—gentle, hydrating formulas suit dry skin, while oil-free or foaming ones benefit oily or acne-prone skin. Ingredients like salicylic acid target acne, while hyaluronic acid provides hydration. Use lukewarm water to cleanse, massaging the facewash gently in circular motions before rinsing thoroughly. Avoid harsh scrubbing to prevent irritation. Regular use, typically twice daily, keeps skin clean, refreshed, and better prepared for subsequent skincare steps.`,

    content: `A cleanser is a fundamental skincare product that removes dirt, oil, makeup, and impurities from the skin's surface. It helps prevent clogged pores, breakouts, and dullness, ensuring a fresh and clean base for other products. Cleansers come in various types, such as gel, foam, cream, oil, and micellar water, tailored to different skin types. For oily skin, a foaming or gel cleanser works best, while cream or oil-based cleansers suit dry or sensitive skin. Use it morning and evening by gently massaging it onto damp skin, then rinsing thoroughly. A good cleanser leaves skin clean but not overly stripped or tight.
